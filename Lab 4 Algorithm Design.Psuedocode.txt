Problem Description: Create a python program that can convert Dungeons and Dragons currencies to other forms of currencies based off of input from the user,
The program should take multiple inputs to account for the various coin types in DnD. It should then request what coin type to convert to.
The utility file associated with the executable file should contain all of the functions needed to convert the user's inputs.

Step 1: Create a utility file containing the functions needed to convert the coin types given.
	a. Coin types needed:
        	-Gold
        	-Silver
        	-Platinum
        	-Copper
        	-Electrum
	b. Gold should be converted to each coin type
        	Example: coinType = coin/gold or coin*gold
	c. Each coin type should be converted to gold
        	Example: coinType = gold/coin or gold*coin
	d. A function needs to be created to add all of the values together once converted 	to gold
        	def goldTotal(a,b,c,d,e):
            		totalGold=a+b+c+d+e
            		return totalGold

Step 2: Begin the exectuable file to take user input
	a. Import the utility file
		import utilityFile
	b. Ask for user input
		name=input("ask for name")
		coinAmount=input("enter how much of coin you have")
		#do this for every coin type
	c. Convert the inputs from str to float
		coinAmount=float(coinAmount)
	d. Call the conversions to gold using user inputs
		utilityFile.coinConversion(coinAmount)
	e. Call function to combine the values into one gold amount
		utilityFile.goldTotal(a+b+c+d+e)
	f. Ask user what they want to convert to
		userConvert=input("what to convert to).lower()
	g. Use elif statements to print the conversion
		if userConvert=="coin":
			print("you have # coin")
		elif userConvert=="nextcoin":
			print("you have # this coin")
		else:
			print("invalid coin, aborted")
